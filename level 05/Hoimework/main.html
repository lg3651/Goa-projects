        <p>Keanu Charles Reeves (/kiˈɑːnuː/ kee-AH-noo;[4][5][6] born September 2, 1964) is a Canadian[c] actor. A recipient of numerous accolades in a career spanning four decades, The New York Times ranked him as the fourth greatest actor of the 21st century in 2020,[9] and Time magazine named him one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2022.[10]

            Born in Beirut and raised in Toronto, he made his acting debut in the Canadian television series Hangin' In (1984), before making his feature film debut in Youngblood (1986).

            Following several box office disappointments, Reeves's performance in the horror film The Devil's Advocate (1997) was well received. Greater stardom came for playing Neo in The Matrix (1999), with Reeves becoming the highest paid actor for a single production for reprising the role in the sequels Reloaded and Revolutions (both 2003). He played John Constantine in Constantine (2005) and starred in the romantic drama The Lake House (2006), the science fiction thriller The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008), and the crime thriller Street Kings (2008).

Following another commercially down period, Reeves made a career comeback by playing the titular assassin in the action film John Wick (2014) and its subsequent installments.
