<!--Create a simple HTML form with two input fields: one for the user's name and one for their email address. Add a submit button.

Add labels to the input fields created in Task 1 to ensure that each field is clearly identified.

Modify the form from Task 1 to include placeholder text in each input field. For example, use "Enter your name" in the name field.

Make the email field required so that the form cannot be submitted without an email address.

Add a password field to the form. Ensure that the text entered in this field is hidden.

Create a set of radio buttons that allow the user to select their gender (e.g., Male, Female, Other). Ensure only one option can be selected at a time.

Add a checkbox that allows users to agree to terms and conditions before submitting the form.-->
